* IF for Atf5 (red) with DAPI (left panel), IF for Adcy3 (green) with DAPI (middle panel) and IF for Atf5 and Adcy3 (right panel) in a section from a P0 Perk +/− animal.
* IF for the same markers in a Perk −/− littermate. Quantification of the numbers of ATF5-expressing cells and the intensity of IF signal shown in Supplemental Figure S4A,B.
* A female Lsd fl/fl mated to a male Lsd fl/+; Foxg1-Cre was given a single IP injection of tunicamycin at E16.5. At E17.5 pups were collected and sectioned. Shown is IF for Atf5 (red) and DAPI (left panel) and IF for Adcy3 (green) and Atf5 (red). For comparison with Foxg1-Cre; Lsd fl/fl or Lsd fl/+, see Figure 1 and for quantification of the numbers of ATF5-expressing cells see Supplemental Figure S4A.
