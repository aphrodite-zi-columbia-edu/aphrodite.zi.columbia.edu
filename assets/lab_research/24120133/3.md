* A genetic strategy to assay the stability of OR expression. One copy of the MOR28 gene also drives expression of Cre recombinase (MOR28-IRES-Cre), excising a stop signal from a Rosa lox-stop-lox-Tomato allele, permanently labeling the OSN with Tomato fluorescent protein. Cells with stable MOR28-IRES-Cre expression (left, yellow) are positive for Tomato and MOR28 as assayed by antibody staining, while cells with unstable MOR28-IRES-Cre expression (right, red), are positive for Tomato only. Cells that choose the wild type MOR28 allele are only green.
* Sections from P40 MOR28-IRES-Cre; lox-stop-lox-Tomato; Atf5 +/− (left panels) or Atf5 −/− (right panels). MOR28 IF (green) alone (bottom) and with Tomato reporter (red) are shown (top).
* Quantification of gene switching from animals shown in (B). Data represented as percentage Tomato+/MOR28− cells over percentage Tomato+/MOR28+ cells. p-value <2.2e–16 (Fisher's test).
