(A–F) Sections from P40 Atf5+/− (left panels) and P40 −/− (right panels) stained with antibodies against:

* Adcy3 (A–B)
* 
* Lsd1 (C–D)
* 
* or MOR28 (E–F). Shown with or without DAPI merge. 
* 
* Arrows in (F) point to ER regions with MOR28 aggregates only seen in ATF5 KO MOEs. Quantitation of the IF signal intensities for LSD1 and MOR28, as well as quantification of the number of MOR28+ OSNs are shown in Supplemental Figure S2A–C.
* Boxplot summary of expression of refseq ORs from mRNA-seq on P40 Atf5 +/+ (orange, 1041 ORs detected) and Atf5 −/− (green, 939 ORs detected). Pseudogene ORs excluded.
* RPKM values normalized to wild-type for developmental markers. Atf5 +/+ shown in orange and Atf5 −/− in green. See Supplemental Figure S2D for expression levels of additional developmental markers.
