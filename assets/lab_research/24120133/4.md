* IF for Atf5 (red) with DAPI (left panel), IF for Adcy3 (green) with DAPI (middle panel) and IF for Atf5 and Adcy3 (right panel) in a section from a P0 Eif2 S51A/+ animal.
* IF for the same markers in a littermate Eif2 S51A/S51A animal. ATF5 mRNA levels in control and mutant MOEs shown in Supplemental Figure S3A.
* IF for the same markers in an Eif2 S51A/S51A animal with transgenic Atf5 rescue (Gng8-tta; tetO-Atf5).
* Genetic strategy for Atf5 transgenic rescue. Endogenous Atf5 protein is expressed just prior to Adcy3 expression (left). Eif2 phosphomutants (S51A/S51A) fail to express Atf5 or Adcy3 (middle). Transient expression of the Atf5 coding sequence under the control of Gng8-tta results in a pattern of Atf5 expression slightly expanded towards the basal MOE, and partially rescues Adcy3 expression (see Supplemental Figure 3C for quantification).
